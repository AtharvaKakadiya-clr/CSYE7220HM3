Take me down to the river bend <br>
Take me down to the fighting end <br>
Wash the poison from off my skin <br>
Show me how to be whole again <br>
Fly me up on a silver wing <br>
Past the black where the sirens sing <br>
Warm me up in a nova's glow <br>
And drop me down to the dream below <br>
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass <br>
Hardly anything there for you to see <br>
For you to see <br>
Bring me home in a blinding dream <br>
Through the secrets that I have seen <br>
Wash the sorrow from off my skin <br>
Show me how to be whole again <br>
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass <br>
Hardly anything there for you to see <br>
For you to see <br>
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass <br>
Hardly anything else I need to be <br>
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass <br>
Hardly anything there for you to see <br>
For you to see <br>
For you to see <br>
