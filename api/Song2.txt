[Verse 1] <br>
Maybe I've been slipping back, heading south, carsick on a Tuesday <br>
Missing cash, blacking out, heartless in a few ways <br>
Shit for luck, elbows shredded, I held things steady like too late <br>
Please calm the fuck down, I'll do whatever you say <br>
I get it, I get it, I'm living too hard and it's time that I stop it <br>
But rising on up and then tumbling down well it's part of the process <br>
Bar tabs on a hot night in a cold basement <br>
You say I'm crazy but I feel amazing <br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus] <br>
My mother told me that the world has got its plans <br>
I wanna hold em til they burn right through my hands <br>
Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing <br>
And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change <br>
<br>
[Chorus] <br>
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake <br>
Cause I've been running, running, running all day <br>
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake <br>
Cause I've been running, running, running all day <br>
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
[Verse 2] <br>
Maybe I've been freaking out, moving quick, burning the wick at both ends <br>
Screaming loud, stupid shit, scaring all of my old friends <br>
Fell down on Bedford, hope that it's not broken <br>
Safe to say I might have had too much of some of these potions <br>
I love you so much, I'm staying here all night <br>
Don't want to get up, I don't want to stop, I don't want to close my eyes <br>
I'd rather not give a fuck and end up with some scars <br>
The night's just long enough for me to build it all and let it fall apart <br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus] <br>
My mother told me that the world has got its plans <br>
I wanna hold em til they burn right through my hands <br>
Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing <br>
And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change <br>
<br>
[Chorus] <br>
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake <br>
Cause I've been running, running, running all day <br>
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake <br>
Cause I've been running, running, running all day <br>
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
I can't sleep, I can't sleep <br>
